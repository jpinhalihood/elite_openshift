<b>Q: Who are Elite Disc Jockey Systems?</b><br><br>

<b>A:</b><i> Elite Disc Jockey Systems is based in Halifax. We are Atlantic Canada’s hottest dance company. We’ve been providing the best Sound, Video & Lighting Shows in the Maritimes for over 15 years.  
</i>
<br><br><br>

<b>Q: Will you travel to any school in Atlantic Canada?</b><br><br>
<b>A:</b><i> We can provide the biggest dance party at any school in Atlantic Canada. We travel throughout Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and P.E.I. 
</i>
<br><br><br>

<b>Q: Are travel fees added to the price of the dance?</b><br><br>
<b>A:</b><i> No. The price we offer includes EVERYTHING! The only other charge will be   
   HST.
</i>
<br><br><br>

<b>Q: We’ve had problems with DJ companies in the past not acting professional when 
  dealing with students, smoking on school property, etc.</b><br><br> 
<b>A:</b><i> Elite Disc Jockey Systems doesn’t just hire anyone off the street. They must meet 
 strict requirements to become a member of the team. We train them to be the best at what they do. The last thing you should have to deal with at an event is a DJ acting unprofessional. </i>
</i>
<br><br><br>

<b>Q: We have had DJ companies cancel on us at the last minute, which leaves us
 scrambling to find a replacement.</b><br><br>
<b>A:</b><i> Elite Disc Jockey Systems requires the signing of a contract for each and every event. We will also be in contact with you the week of the event to make sure there are no last minute surprises.  We haven’t missed a show in 15 years. </i>
</i>
<br><br><br>

<b>Q: Do we save money by booking more then one dance at a time? </b><br><br>
<b>A:</b><i> YES! The easiest way to save $$$ when booking dances with us is to book for the 
entire year. We offer discounts to any school that books more then one dance at a time. The more you book the more you save. 
</i>
<br><br><br>

<b>Q: What happens if we cancel a dance? Do we have to pay a cancellation fee?</b><br><br>

<b>A:</b><i> If you have to cancel a show, we will do our best to accommodate your event on
 a day that is suitable for you. If you reschedule the event we will waive any cancellation fees.
</i>
<br><br><br>

<b>Q: What makes Elite Disc Jockey Systems different from other DJ companies?</b><br><br>
<b>A:</b><i> At Elite Disc Jockey Systems we want every event to be a huge success. The way we do that is to provide the best service at an affordable price. We promise not to sell you a 10,000 watt show if you only need 5000 watts. We show up and are set up on time. Do what ever it takes to ensure everyone has a great time. If the customer wants us back again and again we have achieved our goal. 
</i>
<br><br><br>

<b>Q: Do you take requests? Every DJ says they do. </b><br><br>
<b>A:</b><i> Elite Disc Jockey Systems takes requests all night long. In fact we encourage 
people to come up and request songs. We do our best to play as many requests as time allows. You can also email requests to us before the dance even starts. 
</i>
<br><br><br>

<b>Q: We have a hard time making any money from the dances. What can Elite do to help us?</b><br><br>

<b>A:</b><i> We have the largest digital music library in the business. It has the latest music to music from years ago. We do not burn CD’s because the music we play must be licensed. We belong to a CD Pool that keeps us up to date on all the latest music.
